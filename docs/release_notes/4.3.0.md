# OpenConext EngineBlock v4.3.0 Release Notes #

Full support for SP Proxies and improvements to error handling.

SP Proxies are Service Providers that:
* Have 'coin:trusted_proxy' set/
* Sign their AuthnRequests
* Mention another Service Provider, also known to EB, in the AuthnRequest > Scoping > RequesterId.

For these proxies EB will act like a big brother and do consent, attribute release, WAYF and attribute manipulation
for them. Most notable implementation is the upcoming SURFconext Step Up Gateway.

List of issues resolved:

* EB > 4 accepts SAML Responses over HTTP Redirect #83
* Remove Management of 3rd party OpenSocial Group Providers from Profile #81
* WAYF screen not valid HTML #79
* Consistently apply licensing file header #76
* Remove Internal endpoint #74
* Full support for SP Proxies #64
* Show more informative error when IdP denies user access #61
* Add specific error message for IdP cert mismatch #55
* Improve error message for invalid IdP signing certificate #25
