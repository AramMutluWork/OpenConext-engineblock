# OpenConext EngineBlock v4.7.0 Release Notes #

EngineBlock is now a eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) Policy Enforcement Point (PEP).
If the metadata for a Service Provider specifies that a Policy Decision Point (PDP) should be consulted
then EB will send an Access Request to the PDP and enforce the result.

This release also **completely removes Virtual Organization support**.
If a /vo: part is passed in the URL EB will halt with an error.
