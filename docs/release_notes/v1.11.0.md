Pre-update actions
------------------

Update the Service Registry.
Log in to the Service Registry.
For every SP do the following:
* Edit the SP
* Go to the "Identity Provider (IdP)" tab.
* If "Allow All" has been selected, go on with the next SP.
* Otherwise:
* Check that only 1 IdP has been selected and it is a VO (Entity ID should start with https://engine.surfconext.nl and end with vo:....)
* Select the id of the VO. For instance 'managementvo' in: https://engineblock.surfconext.nl/authentication/idp/metadata/vo:managementvo
* Go to the Metadata tab.
* Add the coin:default_vo_id attribute.
* Fill the previously copied VO id in.
* Save.
* Go back to the "Identity Provider (IdP)" tab.
* Check 'Allow All'.
* Save.

Next delete all VO Idps:
* Go to the dashboard
* Go to the 'Admin' tab
* Go to the 'Connections' sub-tab
* Click Delete for all VO Idps (start with https://engineblock.surfconext.nl and end in vo:....)

Make VERY sure you have done this for the Service Registry SP and the manage SP before updating EngineBlock.
