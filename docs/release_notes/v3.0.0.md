# SURFnet SURFconext v3.0.0 Release Notes #

Bugfix release

Bbugfixes in v3.0.0:
* BACKLOG-826: Consent disabeling in Janus is broken -> This turned out to be more of feature since per SP consent handling code in Engine Block was non-existent.
* BACKLOG-860: EB request for a transient NameID from all IdPs (AuthnRequest). Independent of settings in Janus
* BACKLOG-880: Error generating SP specific metadata for some SP EntityIDs
* BACKLOG-882: Consent shows all attributes independent of ARP
* BACKLOG-910: EngineBlock Sysloghandler breaks when splitting log messages

Post Update
-------------

By TPMs: Possibly configure NameIDFormat for Idp's in Service Registry if not set since it is no longer set to a default value of transient
By TPMs: Possbily correct NameIDFormat unspecified from 2.0 to 1.1. NameIDFormat unspecified does no longer exist in SAML 2.0
    But was used mistakenly used in Engineblock and as such configured in service registry. Both Engineblock and service registry
    now also support the correct version (1.1) so this can be used if required. In time this configuration should be
    corrected everywhere.
