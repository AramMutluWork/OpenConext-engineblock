# SURFnet SURFconext v3.8.0 Release Notes #

Feature/Bugfix release

* BACKLOG-1081 Improve error handling of SAML login in HTML frame (third party cookies)
    Improve the error message when third party cookies (like a HTML frame) prevent SSO.

* BACKLOG-1282 The CERT data is stripped of new lines and spaces, but not tabs
    EngineBlock_X509Certificate strips new lines and spaces and now also tabs out of the certificate.

* BACKLOG-976 ARP processing based on attribute-values should uses wildcards or regex
    EngineBlock uses the ARP to determine which attributes are returned to the SP. There are now three options:
    - Wildcard ('*') meaning any value is allowed
    - Exact match meaning the attribute value from the IdP must be an exact match with the configured value in the ARP
    - Prefix matching meaning the attribute value from the IdP must start with the configured value in the ARP
